# LipmaaEtAl_theorem_three_check

To check theorem 3 works at first you need to load matrices for fast computation adp(a, b, c) function, 
after call int check_theorem(FILE * fout, const int N, Matrix matricies[]), which is declared in theorem3.h, 
to check theorem works with fixed N (number of bits of adp-function arguments).
